\label{sec:how-to-read-this-document}

The paper is broken into this Introduction, sections on Color Science and Workflow and an Appendix. The ordering of the content should introduce a reader new to the subject to the concepts and terminology needed to understand successive topics. For those focused on specific production workflows or challenges, it is reasonable to follow from the Introduction to Workflow, referring to Color Science, as needed. The Appendix provides more applied examples and explanation where it was deemed appropriate.
