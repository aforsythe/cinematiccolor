abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ACM. The human visual system (HVS) non-linearly processes light from the real world, allowing us to perceive detail over a wide range of illumination. Although models that describe this non-linearity are constructed based on psycho-visual experiments, they generally apply to a limited range of illumination and therefore may not fully explain the behavior of theHVS under more extreme illumination conditions. We propose a modified experimental protocol for measuring visual responses to emissive stimuli that do not require participant training, nor requiring the exclusion of non-expert participants. Furthermore, the protocol can be applied to stimuli covering an extended luminance range. Based on the outcome of our experiment, we propose a new model describing lightness response over an extended luminance range. The model can be integrated with existing color appearance models or perceptual color spaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in high dynamic range applications, we evaluate its suitability for dynamic range expansion relative to existing solutions.},

abstract = {Since Hartline's (1938) account of single unit preparations of the frog's retina it has been clear that different ganglion cells respond to different features ofthe retinal image. He recognized three classes, those responding only when a light stimulus was turned 'on', those responding only at 'off', and those responding at both 'on' and 'off'. These classes differ from each other also in the rate of adaptation of the discharge, and in the presence or absence of inhibition from the surround (Barlow, 1953). Lettvin, Maturana, McCulloch & Pitts (1959) described additional types of unit that respond to 'convexity' of a dark object, and to 'net dimming' of the visual field. In the cat Kuffler (1953) described only two classes, those having an 'on' centre with an 'off' surround, and the converse type having 'off' centre and 'on' surround. Wiesel (1960), using smaller electrodes, found units with smaller receptive fields, and in the spider monkey Hubel & Wiesel (1960) found a few cells with colour specific responses. Wolbarsht, Wagner & MacNichol (1961) have found units in fish retinae with different spectral sensitivity for centre- and surround-type responses, and de Valois & Jones (1961) have evidence for similar 'colour-coding' in monkeys. In pigeons Maturana & Frenk (1963) have described two classes of units detecting direction of movement and horizontal edges respectively. Thus each animal has several classes of retinal unit, but the classes are different in},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Age-related changes in tongue function may contribute to dysphagia in elderly people. The authors' purpose was to investigate whether aged rats that have undergone tongue exercise would manifest increased protrusive tongue forces and increased genioglossus (GG) muscle fiber cross-sectional areas. METHOD: Forty-eight young adult, middle-aged, and old Fischer 344/Brown Norway rats received 8 weeks of tongue exercise. Protrusive tongue forces were measured before and after exercise. GG muscle fiber cross-sectional area was measured in exercised rats and was compared with cross-sectional areas in a no-exercise control group. RESULTS: A significant increase in maximum tongue force was found following exercise in all age groups. In addition, a trend for increased GG muscle fiber cross-sectional area and a significant increase in variability of GG muscle fiber cross-sectional area was identified postexercise. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study have implications for treatment of elderly persons with dysphagia using tongue exercise programs. Specifically, increases in tongue force that occur following 8 weeks of progressive resistance tongue exercise may be accompanied by alterations in tongue muscle fiber morphology. These changes may provide greater strength and endurance for goal-oriented actions associated with the oropharyngeal swallow and should be investigated in future research.},

abstract = {Following our success with physically-based hair shading on Tangled [27], we began considering physically- based shading models for a broader range of materials. With the physically-based hair model, we were able to achieve a great degree of visual richness while maintaining artistic control. However, it proved challenging to integrate the lighting of the hair with the rest of the scene which had still used tradi- tional “ad-hoc” shading models and punctual lights. For subsequent films we wanted to increase the richness of all of our materials while making lighting responses more consistent between materials and environments and also wanted to improve artist productivity through the use of simplified controls. When we began our investigation it wasn't obvious which models to use or even how physically- based we wanted to be. Should we be perfectly energy conserving? Should we favor physical parameters like index-of-refraction? For diffuse, Lambert seemed to be the accepted norm, while specular seemed to get most of the attention in the literature. Some models such as Ashikhmin-Shirley (2000) [3] aimed to be intuitive and practical while physically plausible, while others such as He et al. (1991) [12] provided a more comprehensive physical model. Still others aimed at improved data fitting [15, 14, 22, 17, 4], but few of these are appropriate for direct manipulation. We could have implemented several models and let the artists choose and combine them, but then we'd have been back to the parameter explosion we were trying to get away from. One study of a large variety of measured materials was Ngan et al. (2005) [21] which compared five popular models. Some models fared better than others overall, but interestingly, there was a strong correlation between the models' performances – some materials were well represented by all the models, and for others, no model proved suitable. Adding an additional specular lobe helped in only a few of the cases. This begs the question, what is not being represented in the difficult materials? To answer this question and to evaluate BRDF models more intuitively we developed a new BRDF viewer that could display and compare both measured and analytic BRDFs. We discovered new, intu- itive ways to view measured BRDF data and we found interesting features in the measured materials that weren't well-represented by known models. In these course notes we will share observations from studying measured materials along with insights we've gleaned about which models fit the measured data and where they fall short. We will then present our new model which is now being used on all current productions. We will also describe our experience of adopting this new model in production and discuss how we were able to add the right level of artistic control while preserving simplicity and robustness.},

abstract = {We propose that retinal-based phototrophy arose early in the evolution of life on Earth, profoundly impacting the development of photosynthesis and creating implications for the search for life beyond our planet. While the early evolutionary history of phototrophy is largely in the realm of the unknown, the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis in primitive cyanobacteria significantly altered the Earth's atmosphere by contributing to the rise of oxygen ∼2.3 billion years ago. However, photosynthetic chlorophyll and bacterio chlorophyll pigments lack appreciable absorption at wavelengths about 500-600 nm, an energy-rich region of the solar spectrum. By contrast, simpler retinal-based light-harvesting systems such as the haloarchaeal purple membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin show a strong well-defined peak of absorbance centred at 568 nm, which is complementary to that of chlorophyll pigments. We propose a scenario where simple retinal-based light-harvesting systems like that of the purple chromo-protein bacteriorhodopsin, originally discovered in halophilic Archaea, may have dominated prior to the development of photosynthesis. We explore this hypothesis, termed the 'Purple Earth,' and discuss how retinal photopigments may serve as remote biosignatures for exo-planet research. Background},

abstract = {The conifer leaf model LIBERTY (Leaf Incorporating Biochemistry Exhibiting Reflectance and Transmittance Yields) is an adaptation of radiative transfer theory for determining the optical properties of powders. LIBERTY provides a simulation, at a fine spectral resolution, of quasiinfinite leaf reflectance (as represented by stacked leaves) and single leaf reflectance. Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models. A prototype parameterization of LIBERTY was based upon measurements of pine needles mid known absorption coefficients of pure component leaf biochemicals. The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87% and 1.73%, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RSME of 1.84% and 1.12%, respectively. Initial inversion studies have demonstrated that significant improvements can be made to LIBERTY by utilizing in vivo absorption coefficients which have been determined by the inversion process. These results demonstrate the capability of LIBERTY to model accurately the spectral response, of pine needles.},

To improve contrast in dark areas, changes to the gamma correction procedure are proposed. Our adaptive logarithmic mapping technique is capable of producing perceptually tuned images with high dynamic content and works at interactive speed. We demonstrate a successful application of our tone mapping technique with a high dynamic range video player enabling to adjust optimal viewing conditions for any kind of display while taking into account user preference concerning brightness, contrast compression, and detail reproduction.},

@article{Fairchild1995,
abstract = {Observer production of achromatic appearance has previously been used to measure the time course of chromatic adaptation for changes from daylight to incandescent illuminants at constant luminance, indicating an exponential decay of chromatic adaptation with a time constant of the order of 10 s. The work extends previous results in several ways. The psychophysical technique was significantly improved to provide more reliable estimates of color appearance as a function of adaptation duration, and the time course of chromatic adaptation was measured for six chromaticity changes. Three observers tracked achromatic appearance on a computer-controlled CRT display during transitions of 2-min duration between the various chromaticities. The results indicate that observer differences are statistically significant. However, differences in time course for different chromaticity changes are not statistically significant (within observer). Single or piecewise exponential decay functions cannot be fitted to the data. However, sum-of-two-exponentials functions provided accurate descriptions of the data. The results suggest two stages of adaptation: one extremely rapid (a few seconds) and the other somewhat slower (approximately 1 min). Chromatic adaptation at constant luminance was 90% complete after approximately 60 s.},

The model captures the changes in threshold visibility, color appearance, visual acuity, and sensitivity over time that are caused by the visual system's adaptation mechanisms. We use the model to display the results of global illumination simulations illuminated at intensities ranging from daylight down to starlight. The resulting images better capture the visual characteristics of scenes viewed over a wide range of illumination levels. Because the model is based on psychophysical data it can be used to predict the visibility and appearance of scene features. This allows the model to be used as the basis of perceptually-based error metrics for limiting the precision of global illumination computations.},

abstract = {Traditional color vision theory posits that three types of retinal photopigments transduce light into a trivariate neural color code, thereby explaining color-matching behaviors. Thisprinciple of trichromacy is in need of reexamination in view of molecular genetics results suggesting that a substantial percentage of women possess more than three classes of retinal photopigments. At issue is the question of whether four-photopigment retinas necessarily yield trichromatic color perception. In the present paper, we review results and theory underlying the accepted photoreceptor-based model of trichromacy. A review of the psychological literature shows that gender-linked differences in color perception warrant further investigation of retinal photopigment classes and color perception relations. We use genetic analyses to examine an important position in the gene sequence, and we empirically assess and compare the color perception of individuals possessing more than three retinal photopigment genes with those possessing fewer retinal photopigment genes. Women with four-photopigment genotypes are found to perceive significantly more chromatic appearances in comparison with either male or female trichromat controls. We provide a rationale for this previously undetected finding and discuss implications for theories of color perception and gender differences in color behavior.},

abstract = {The electronic display industry has begun a migration towards higher color gamut devices driven by LED, OLED, quantum dot and laser technologies capable of generating near monochromatic color stimuli in the traditional red, green, blue three-channel paradigm. The use of highly selective spectral stimuli, however, poses a risk to the consistency of visual experience amongst a group of disparate, but otherwise normal, color observers. Several models of spectral color vision have surfaced in recent research and are helping investigators to better understand the implications for color experience variability. The present research serves to summarize various color difference indices that may be useful in predicting the magnitude of observer response inconsistencies and applies them to simulations of current electronic displays as examples of potential concerns these new high-gamut technologies might raise. In particular, various laser-based displays are shown to perform with significantly increased observer variability versus traditional ITU-R Rec. 709 and SMPTE 431 RGB-primary displays utilized in the cinema industry. Further, observer metamerism can be reduced significantly with proper optimization of a multichannel projection system comprising seven explicitly designed primary spectra.},

abstract = {High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Wider Colour Gamut (WCG) content represents a greater range of luminance levels and a more complete reproduction of colours found in real⁃world scenes. The current video distribution environments deliver Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) signal Y′CbCr. For HDR and WCG content, it is desirable to examine if such signal format still works well for compression, and to know if the overall system performance can be further improved by exploring different signal formats. In this paper, ITP (ICTCP) colour space is presented. The paper concentrates on examining the two aspects of ITP colour space: 1) ITP characteristics in terms of signal quantization at a given bit depth; 2) ITP compression performance. The analysis and simulation results show that ITP 10 bit has better properties than Y′CbCr⁃PQ 10bit in colour quantization, constant luminance, hue property and chroma subsampling, and it also has good compression efficiency. Therefore it is desirable to adopt ITP colour space as a new signal format for HDR/WCG video compression.},

abstract = {The use of the I. C. I. 1931 Standard Observer and Coordinate System for Colorimetry for all general color specifications and calculations is urged for the elimination of confusion in the field of colorimetry. Methods for constructing other coordinate systems are exhibited, and interpretations are given for the eight independent constants in the equations for transformation from the I. C. 1. to other coordinate systems. Expressions are derived for the luminosity coefficients in terms of the constants of the equations for the transformation of coordinates. The possibility of assigning luminosity coefficients without restricting the shape of the spectrum locus is discussed, and an example is given. The assignment of luminosity coefficients interferes with the assignment of the shape of the spectrum locus only in the case of three equal luminosity coefficients. In general, two of the eight degrees of freedom which are available in the defining equations of a trichromatic coordinate system are eliminated by the assignment of the luminosity coefficients. Except in the case of three equal luminosity coefficients, four of the six remaining degrees of freedom are eliminated when the shape of the spectrum locus is established. One additional degree of freedom is eliminated when the size of the spectrum locus is assigned. The final degree of freedom is most profitably used for the purpose of simplifying the transformation equations. The entire discussion is based on well-known principles of transformation of color mixture data and projective geometry; no assumptions other than those underlying standard trichromatic color specification are made, and no conclusions of physiological or psychological import are justified.},

abstract = {An apparatus is described which facilitates the presentation of pairs of variable colors without variation of luminance. With this instrument, various criteria of visual sensitivity to color difference have been investigated. The standard deviation of color matching was finally adopted as the most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees in diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed centrally with a surrounding field of fortytwo degrees diameter uniformly illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that of the I.C.I. Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The luminance of the test field was maintained constant at 15 millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 7.5 millilamberts. These fields were viewed monocularly through an artificial pupil, 2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at color matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the readings are analyzed in detail and compared with previously available data. The standard deviations of the trials are represented in terms of distance in the standard 1931 I.C.I. chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance are represented as functions of position along straight lines in the chromaticity diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such representations are simpler than the traditional representations of wavelength thresholds and purity thresholds as functions of wave-length, and the accuracy of the representations is improved by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination for non-spectral colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis as for spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity differences are represented for all chromaticities and for all kinds of variations by the lengths of the radii of a family of ellipses drawn on the standard chromaticity diagram. These ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized circles by any projective transformation of the standard chromaticity diagram. The consistency of these data with the results of other investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of wave-length differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities of purity differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of dominant wave-length.},

Our model is based on the stage theory of human color vision and is derived from data reported in electrophysiological studies. It is the first model to consistently handle normal color vision, anomalous trichromacy, and dichromacy in a unified way. We have validated the proposed model through an experimental evaluation involving groups of color vision deficient individuals and normal color vision ones. Our model can provide insights and feedback on how to improve visualization experiences for individuals with CVD.

abstract = {All successful imaging systems employ some form of color management for previewing, controlling and adjusting color throughout the image-production process. Today's increasingly complex systems pose challenging problems: they must support numerous devices and media having disparate color properties, and they also must provide for the interchange of images among dissimilar systems. In this book, the authors address and solve these problems using innovative methods of representing color in the digital domain.The second edition of this popular book explains the capabilities and limitations of existing color management systems and provides comprehensive practical solutions for communicating color within and among imaging systems, from the simplest to the most complex. Beginning with the fundamentals of color and human color perception, the book progresses to in-depth analyses of the nature of color images, digital color encoding, color management systems and digital color interchange. Fully revised and updated, this second edition of Digital Color Management features new and expanded coverage including:electronic displays and electronic imaging systems;scene-based and appearance-based color encoding methods;color management for digital cinema;a Unified Paradigm—a comprehensive, integrated color-managed environment for the color-imaging industry;four new chapters, two new appendices, and more than 80 new figures.This book is an essential resource for engineers, programmers and imaging professionals designing and engineering color-imaging systems and for others simply looking to increase their understanding of the field. Scientists, researchers, advanced undergraduates and graduate students involved in imaging technology also will find this book of significant interest and usefulness.Reviews for the first edition:‘The absence of unnecessary jargon, the impeccable writing style, the material depth leads only to one conclusion: If you buy one digital color book this year, buy this one.'

Subjects were adapted to a large uniform background made up of a CRT screen and a 45 x 64°wall, illuminated by computer controlled lamps. After an instant change in background color along a red-green or blue-yellow color axis, we measured thresholds for the detection of increments along the same axes at fixed times between 25 ms and 121 s. Analogously, color appearance was determined using achromatic matching. Three components of adaptation could be identified by their temporal characteristics. A slow exponential time course of adaptation with a half-life of about 20 s was common to appearance and discrimination. A faster component with a half-life of 40-70 ms - probably due to photoreceptor adaptation - was also common to both. Exclusive for color appearance, there was a third, extremely rapid mechanism with a half-life faster than 10 ms. This instantaneous process explained more than 50% of total adaptation for color appearance and could be shown to act in a multiplicative manner. We conclude that this instantaneous adaptation mechanism for color appearance is situated at a later processing stage, after mechanisms common to appearance and discrimination, and is based on multiplicative spatial interactions rather than on local, temporal adaptational processes. Color appearance, and thus color constancy, seems to be determined in large part by cortical computations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A perceptually uniform color space has been long desired for a wide range of imaging applications. Such a color space should be able to represent a color pixel in three unique and independent attributes (lightness, chroma, and hue). Such a space would be perceptually uniform over a wide gamut, linear in iso-hue directions, and can predict both small and large color differences as well as lightness in high dynamic range environments. It would also have minimum computational cost for real time or quasi-real time processing. Presently available color spaces are not able to achieve these goals satisfactorily and comprehensively. In this study, a uniform color space is proposed and its performance in predicting a wide range of experimental data is presented in comparison with the other state of the art color spaces.},

Model results were evaluated using the correlation coefficients of the prediction (Rp) and calibration (Rc); root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and the ratio of sample standard deviation to RMSEP (RPD). The developed models performance yielded 0.951 ≤ Rp ≤ 0.975; and 3.15 ≤ RPD ≤ 4.32. The models' prediction stability improved in the order of PLS < CARS-PLS < ACO-PLS < Si-PLS < Si-GAPLS.

Each white balancing method was exercised in turn, and the mean and 90th percentile ∆E* ab were determined. We found that illuminant-dependent characterization produced the best results, sharpened camera RGB and native camera RGB were next best, XYZ and CAM02 were often not far behind, and balancing in the -709 primaries was signiﬁcantly worse. We recommend that, whenever the illuminant is identiﬁed, the illuminant-dependent technique be employed because of its superior performance.},

The comparative retinal histological structures and visual pigment characteristics including opsin gene sequences, of four species of moray eel inhabiting diverse habitats (i.e., shallow-water species, Rhinomuraena quaesita and Gymnothorax favagineus, and deep-sea species, Gymnothorax reticularis and Strophidon sathete) were examined. The histological sections showed that retinal layer structures of R. quaestia are significantly different from those of the other three species which likely reflects the effects of distribution depth on the structures. The maximal absorbance wavelength ($\lambda$max) of photoreceptor cells, as measured by microspectrophotometry (MSP), showed a close correlation between the $\lambda$maxand the intensity/spectral quality of the light environment where each species lives. The spectra-shift, between shallow and deep-sea species, observed in the rods cells results from amino acid substitution in Rh1 gene, while that in cones most likely results from differential expression of multiple Rh2 genes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The variations in the coefficients that have been found amongst the ten observers must, as a\n consequence of a new method of basing the trichromatic units, be attributed to variations in the\n process of reception, but their magnitude appears to be of a small order. On the other hand, there\n are big differences in the amount of the macular pigment in different eyes and probably some\n variation in its dominant hue. These variations have been investigated by matches on a standard\n white, results for 36 observers being given in the paper and a mean value determined. This value,\n combined with the mean spectral coefficients, has been used to compute an average locus for the\n spectral colours in the colour triangle, with white at the centre.\n \n Other points discussed in the paper include the technique of colour matching, the range of intensity\n over which matches remained valid, and variations of luminosity.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new Bayesian framework for solving the matting problem, i.e. extracting a foreground element from a background image by estimating an opacity for each pixel of the foreground element. Our approach models both the foreground and background color distributions with spatially-varying sets of Gaussians, and assumes a fractional blending of the foreground and background colors to produce the final output. It then uses a maximum-likelihood criterion to estimate the. optimal opacity, foreground and background simultaneously. In addition to providing a principled approach to the matting problem, our algorithm effectively handles objects with intricate boundaries, such as hair strands and fur, and provides an improvement over existing techniques for these difficult cases.},

abstract = {The visual consequences of melanopsin photoreception in humans are not well understood. Here we studied melanopsin photoreception using a technique of photoreceptor silent substitution with five calibrated spectral lights after minimising the effects of individual differences in optical pre-receptoral filtering and desensitising penumbral cones in the shadow of retinal blood vessels. We demonstrate that putative melanopsin-mediated image-forming vision corresponds to an opponent S-OFF L + M-ON response property, with an average temporal resolution up to approximately 5 Hz, and >10x higher thresholds than red-green colour vision. With a capacity for signalling colour and integrating slowly changing lights, melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells maybe the fifth photoreceptor type for peripheral vision.},
