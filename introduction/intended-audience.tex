\section{Intended Audience}

This document is intended for professionals involved in the capture, production and finishing of film, animation, and games, with a particular focus on the computer graphics artists and software developers responsible for visual effects, animation and games color management. A familiarity with computer graphics fundamentals is assumed. As advanced color imaging techniques, like wide color gamut and high-dynamic range capture, processing and display, become more widely used outside of the entertainment space, we expect that this paper will also be relevant to professionals beyond the intended audience. A familiarity with color science and color management is not.
